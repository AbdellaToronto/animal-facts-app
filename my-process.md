# My Process

June 20th:
  * learned about barreling
  * created form
  * select dropdown option in form so the user can choose how many facts they want
  * learned how you can control the amounts of facts by using a parameter
  * based on the selection of the user in the dropdown, it controls how many facts are displayed from the API (since the parameter, in this case `numberOfFacts` acts as the amount of facts)

June 26th:
  * confused about getting Pexels API to work
  * unable to get data back
  * confused about what CORS is and why it's blocking my ability to access this API
  * trying to figure out how to set up a proxy so I can avoid CORS
