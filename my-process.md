# My Process

June 20th:
  * learned about barreling
  * created form
  * select dropdown option in form so the user can choose how many facts they want
  * learned how you can control the amounts of facts by using a parameter
  * based on the selection of the user in the dropdown, it controls how many facts are displayed from the API (since the parameter, in this case `numberOfFacts` acts as the amount of facts)
